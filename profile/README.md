<h1 align="center">DMconnect</h1>

DMconnect is a **decentralized** messenger for legacy systems with encryption capabilities.

It uses a **federated** architecture, similar to email, allowing multiple servers to seamlessly communicate with each other.

The protocol itself is [designed to be as simple as possible](http://dmconnectspec.w10.site), so you can maintain communication using a regular Telnet client. Of course, you are free to create separate client applications.

## Clients
Currently, there are clients for:
- Windows 9x ([ExTO](https://github.com/Archie-boop/ExTO), [DMCVB](https://github.com/tankwars92/DMCVB) and others, [see the full list of clients on the website](http://dmconnect.w10.site/download.html)).
- J2ME ([DMobile](https://github.com/tankwars92/DMobile)).
- Linux ([Dsconnect](http://dsconnect.w10.site)).
